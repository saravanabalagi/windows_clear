# windows_clear
Windows actually clears the terminal, like reset does in *nix, but if you want to clear cmd like in *nix where it's nicely scrolled up and hidden but not cleared for real, this is just for you

# Installion
1. Download `clear.exe`
2. Move the file to `C:\Windows`. 

Note: You can place this file in any of the `PATH` folders. If you have devkit installed move `clear.exe` to `devkit_path\bin` so you have all linux commands in one place :)

Voila. You have now got `clear` command of Linux in Windows.
